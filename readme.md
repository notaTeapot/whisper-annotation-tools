# Whisper Annotation Tools

Whisper Annotation Tools (WAT) is a set of utilities transforming whisper ASR and pyannote.speaker-diarization into transcript formats ready for further linguistic analysis.

Currently supporting:
- insanely-fast-whisper json format as input
- structured output as xml or json for usage with corpus building tools (e.g. sketchengine)
- .lfk output to use with FOLKeR (https://github.com/Exmaralda-Org/exmaralda)
